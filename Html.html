	<p> Key Terms <br/>
<h3> Understand that the Internet supports a range of services such as the World Wide Web (WWW), File Transfer, email, instant messaging (IM) The Internet or "the network of networks" is a public network that connects computers and computer networks around the world through a common protocol (IP).  All connected computers and networks mutually exchange information and use various services. Hence, the Internet is not solely the WWW, or pages and content available from a browser. In fact, the WWW is just one of the services that the Internet offers to its users although it is the most commonly used service. Other available services:  File transfer - the file transfer from one computer to another.</h3><br/>
 <p><h3>E-mail (electronic mail) – it is the oldest Internet service, and it enables the exchange of digital messages between two or more people. <br/>
  Instant messaging (IM) – it enables the exchange of electronic messages between two or more people in real time. Such as chat rooms (Gtalk, MSN, Skype, etc.) that also support nowadays video/ audio/ photo communication exchange.</p>
  </h3><br/>
 
<h3> Understand the term client/server. Understand the functionality and relationship between the browser and the web server 
The Internet is probably the best-known example of a client/ server relationship. The difference between a client and a server is big. Here we have two computers/ programs where the client sends requests to a server, and the server processes requests and returns the results to the client. A server is typically a remote computer not visible to the user.  Web server: is the computer/ server whose entire content is visible on a website in a web browser. Web servers are constantly connected to the Internet. We access them through URL. Therefore, if we enter, for example, www.google.com in a web browser, we are accessing the Google server.  Web browser:<br/>
 enables browsing through websites. Its mechanisms display the content, retrieved from the server, in a correct and understandable way.  As such it is an intermediary between the user and the server. (e.g. Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc.) <br/>.
 Web Publishing <br/>
 Identify the main advantages of having a website: access to a global audience, ease of updating, audience interactivity and cost savings. <br/>
Nowadays more and more people/ companies opt to own a website. Positive sides of creating and having a website are: <br/>
 It is possible to reach a broad audience in an easy way. <br/>
 It is possible to change information from virtually anywhere in real time. If, for example, a website offers some products, it is possible to update prices with just a few clicks. <br/>
 Web sites allow a much better relationship with customers compared to conventional printed materials or advertisements on television or radio. The user can receive information more easily, answer questions, share experiences on a forum (if the page has one), etc. <br/>
 Maintaining a website is far less expensive than advertising on other media. Therefore, an online business can significantly reduce costs for staff, office space, etc.<br/>
  Obtain information of their constumers and create a specific target of their promotion <br/>
. Understand the process of putting a website online: <br/>
domain registration, selecting a web hosting service. The process of putting a website online consists of several steps:<br/>
  Once we create a web page, it is necessary to register a domain, register a unique name that will represent the web page on the Internet. When choosing a domain name one should preferably take into account that the domain should not be too long, it should be constructed well, and customers should be able to remember it easily.<br/>
   We did not reserve a spot for the webpage on the Internet by registering a domain, but we have only defined the website’s address. The next step is selecting a web hosting service or finding a company that offers servers to host a web page. There is a wide range of hosting providers and it is the website owner’s decision to choose a service that suits him the best.  Recognize search engine optimization techniques e.g. including relevant metadata, including a sitemap and website links, registering with a search engine. <br/>
Search engine optimization techniques serve to increase the probability that exactly your website ranks at a higher position among existing search results. In fact, it is the web results on the first few pages that will be visited the most during a web search. The further we look so decreases the results credibility, and thus the attendance of such websites decreases<br/>
 Understand the term copyright and its implications for text, images, audio, and video available on websites <br/>
 
It is a fact that we can easily download many contents from various websites. However, this does not mean that we can further use all website content. Quite contrary, in most cases content is under certain copyright rules. It is only possible to use content from another website freely if the website explicitly states it (“open content“, “Open Source“, “Creative Commons“, etc.). Otherwise, it should be verified under which circumstances it is allowed to download and use them. <br/></h3>
